Mode: omp (Oh My Pi) extension background wake.

When this session owns supervision and away mode is not active:
1. Drain first with `bin/fm-wake-drain.sh`.
   After handling all emitted wakes and reconciling open decisions and unread status lines, run the exact `--ack-through` command printed as `WAKE_ACK_REQUIRED`; until then the work remains durable for idempotent re-handling after interruption.
2. Confirm the omp primary auto-loaded both project extensions from `.omp/extensions/`; omp has no project-trust gate, so a plain `omp` started with this home as its working directory loads them with no dialog.
   If `bin/fm-session-start.sh` reported the omp extensions as not loaded, restart omp inside this home; pass `-e __FM_OMP_TURNEND_EXT__ -e __FM_OMP_EXT__` only when omp must start from another directory, because omp loads a file named both ways twice.
3. Initial process cycle only: make the one required `fm_watch_arm_omp` call; if startup already owned the fleet lock, this is an ownership-based no-op.
   Use `/fm-watch-arm-omp` only as a human-entered fallback.
   Never run `bin/fm-watch-arm.sh` through omp's bash tool because that foreground arm can wedge the agent and bypasses extension-owned cleanup.
4. If the extension says no live session holds the lock, run `bin/fm-session-start.sh` to reclaim the session lock, then call `fm_watch_arm_omp` again.
5. Ordinary work, turn completion, session replacement (`/new`, `/resume`, `/fork`), and ordinary signal, stale, check, heartbeat, or other wake handling: do not call `fm_watch_arm_omp` again because continuity is extension-owned rather than model-memory-owned.
6. Missing, failed, or unhealthy cycle only: if a later notification explicitly reports one of those repair conditions, drain queued wakes, inspect the failure text, call `fm_watch_arm_omp`, and restart omp inside this home if the extensions are not loaded.
   A redundant call while the extension owns an arm child or scheduled retry is an ownership-based `watcher: unchanged` no-op, not an independent health claim.
7. Never use shell `&` for watcher supervision.
   The arm mechanism above is extension-owned, not a model tool call, but a manual recovery probe that backgrounds, pipes, or bundles the arm is denied automatically by the pre-tool seatbelt (`bin/fm-arm-pretool-check.sh`, wired into the turn-end guard extension at `__FM_OMP_TURNEND_EXT__`).

The watcher extension owns every successor launch, generation handoff, bounded retry, and watcher-failure alarm; `.omp/extensions/fm-primary-omp-watch.ts` and [`watcher-continuity.md`](../watcher-continuity.md) own that contract, and [`turnend-guard.md`](../turnend-guard.md) owns the structural `session_stop` guard and its one-continuation bound.
An interrupted turn never raises `session_stop`, so a supervisor-initiated interrupt is not guarded; `bin/fm-control.sh` owns that postcondition.

The Pi supervision branch (`docs/pi-supervision-branch.md`) is out of scope for the omp primary: every actionable wake is delivered to this conversation, exactly as on Claude, and the lease, outcome-store, and `fm_branch_processed` contracts do not apply here.

The turn-end guard extension lives at `__FM_OMP_TURNEND_EXT__`.
The watcher extension lives at `__FM_OMP_EXT__`.
Both are tracked, project-local `.omp/extensions/*.ts` files that omp auto-discovers from this home with no trust dialog; `bin/fm-session-start.sh` reports when the running omp session has not loaded both required extensions.
